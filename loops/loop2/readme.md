# Looping over `Arrays` and `Slices`

We'll loop over a collection of strings. We'll be using a slice, but the loop logic will also be the same set of arrays.  
We'll define the collection; we'll then create a loop that uses the collection to control when to stop looping and a variable to keep track of where we are in the collection.
