# Exercise FizzBuzz

## The rules are

- Write a program that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100
- If the number is a multiple of 3, print `Fizz`
- If the number is multiple of 5, print `Buzz`
- If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`

## Some tips
- You can convert a number to a string using `strconv.Itoa()`
- The first number to evaluate must be 1 and the last number to evaluate must be 100
