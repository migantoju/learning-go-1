# Exersice - Bubble Sort

In this activity, we'll sort a given slice of numbers by swapping the values. This
technique of sorting is known as the bubble sort technique. Go has built-in sorting
algorithms in the sort package but I don't want you to use them; we want you to use the
logic and loops you've just learned.

## Steps

- Define a slice with unsorted numbers in it.
- Print this slice to the console.
- Sort the values using swapping.
- Once done, print the now sorted numbers to the console.

This must be the result:

```sh
Before: [5, 8, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 7, 9, 6]
After: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```
