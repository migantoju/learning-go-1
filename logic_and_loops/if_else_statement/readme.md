# `if-else` Statements

We can represent this kind of logic using an `if-else` statement.  
The notation looks like this:
```go
if <boolean expression> {
    <code block>
} else {
    <code block>
}
```
The `if-else` statement builds on the `if` statement and gives us a second block. The second block only runs if the first block doesn't run; both blocks can't run.
