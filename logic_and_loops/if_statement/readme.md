# `IF` Statement

An `if` statement is the most basic form of logic in Go.  
An `if` statement either will or won't run a block of logic based on
a boolean expression. The notation looks like this: 

```go
if <boolean expression> {
    <code block>
} 
```
The code block can be any logic that you could also put in a function.
