# Numbers

Go has two distinct number types:  
- `Integers`, also known as whole numbers and
- `floating-point` numbers.

A `floating-point` number allows a number with whole numbers and fractions of a whole number.  

1, 54, 365 are examples of whole numbers.  
1.5, 65.3  and 64,567.00001 are all examples of `floating-point` numbers.  

The default and empty values for all number types is `0`.
