# `Go` Core Types

Go is a strongly typed language, and all data is assigned a type.
That type is fixed and can't be changed. What you can and can't do with your data is contrained by the types you assign. Understanding exactly what defines every one of `Go`'s core type is critical to success with the Go Language.

Go's core types are well-thought-out and easy to understand once you understand the
details. Having to understand the details means Go's type system is not always intuitive.
For example, Go's most common number type, int, may be either 32 bits or 64 bits in
size depending on the computer used to compile the code.
